# dotfiles

This directory manages different dotfiles I use for various programs such as
neovim, alacritty, zsh etc.

Where to start?

## ZSH Shell

If you are on a \*nix machine, there is a good possibility you use zsh shell. To check

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

If you get `/bin/zsh`, you're currently using zsh shell. If not please follow This
https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH to install zsh.

The next sane step is to install `oh-my-zsh`. `oh-my-zsh` is a zsh framework.
Follow https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh to install `oh-my-zsh`

For fuzzyfinding, I use fzf. If you don't have it installed, running the .zshrc for the first time
will try to install fzf. After that try to run the binary fzf by

```bash




```
